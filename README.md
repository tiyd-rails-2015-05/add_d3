# Add d3.js

## Description

Given an existing application on a dataset, add a d3 visualization.

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Understand how d3.js fits into the Rails asset pipeline.
* Be able to create simple d3 visualizations.

## Deliverables

* **A Repository.** You will all be forking the code from an existing application.

## Normal Mode

For this assignment, you will be modifying your Novel API assignment.  When you initially built it, you pulled from two APIs and created a new one.  Tonight, you'll be modifying an existing version of this app and adding an HTML root page.  This page will invoke d3.js, and will display an interactive visualization on the datasets.

If your API took input parameters, the user should be able to input this information via a web form.

The visualization must be interactive.  In other words, it cannot be static when the page loads, but must exhibit some behavior when the user interacts with some part of it.
